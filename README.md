Multi-Beam LiDAR
================

This is a fork of the LaserDist mod with some modifications to enable multiple beams and to better interface with kRPC. It also removes the PQS as for the purposes of this mod, long range distances are ignored. This is both to increase performance and add a bit of realism to the LiDAR. 

If you want to use this with kRPC, you will need a modified version (to be added soon).
